# Express prototyping tool

Prototyping tool built in [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

It will give you a basic Express app, with templates, css and images from the [GOV.UK front-end toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit).


## Requirements

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/)

You may already have it, try:

```
node --version
```

## Getting started

* Clone this repo.

* If you don't have Node, download it here: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

* Run the app:


```
node start.js
```

* Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Hot reload

Any code changes should update in the browser without you restarting the app.

The app recompiles app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss everytime changes are observed.
